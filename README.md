# Homework

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Exercise 1

The `Calculator` class for exercise 1 is located in `src/Calculator.ts`. There
are also unit tests that can be executed using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Exercise 2

Exercise 2 was solved using Vite, Vike (formerly vite-plugin-ssr) and React.
Usually I am working with Next.js, but I always wanted to try out SSR with Vite.
So this also is a tiny learning project.

The Vite dev server can be started with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production build and Node.js server can be started with:

```bash
npm run prod
```
